        "\n",
        "Ans:-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods/functions) that the object can have.\n",

        "Ans-Abstraction and Encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They are related but serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Abstraction – Hiding the Complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Focus on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: When you drive a car, you only use the steering wheel, pedals, etc. You don’t need to know how the engine works internally.\n",

        "\n",
        "Definition: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to the internal state.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods) in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods allow you to define how your objects behave with built-in Python operations, such as printing, adding, comparing, and more.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a class (child/subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to reuse existing code, promote code organization, and support polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7.What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Polymorphism means \"many forms\", and in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "It enables you to use the same method name or operator to perform different tasks based on the object that is calling it.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-What is a Constructor in Python?\n",
        "In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a new object when it is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor method is always named:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "__init__()\n",
        "\n",
        "It automatically runs when an object is instantiated, and it's typically used to set up initial values for the object’s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "class ClassName:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, parameters):\n",
        "        # initialization code\n",
        "\n",
        "The first parameter is always self, which refers to the current object.\n",

        "\n",
        "**10.What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, both class methods and static methods are types of methods you can define inside a class, but they behave differently from instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class Method\n",
        "\n",
        "A class method is bound to the class, not the instance.\n",
        "It can access or modify class state that applies across all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Defined with the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "First argument is always cls (refers to the class, not the object).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    species = \"Canine\"  # Class attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Static Method\n",
        "\n",
        "A static method is not bound to the instance or the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It behaves like a regular function but lives in the class’s namespace for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Defined with the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Takes no self or cls parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used when some utility function is related to the class but doesn’t need class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Math:\n",

        "\n",
        "**11.What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Method overloading means having multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number or types of arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "It lets you call the same method name with different kinds of inputs, and the method behaves accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12.What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows the child class to modify or extend the behavior of that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13.What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The @property decorator allows you to define methods in a class that behave like attributes (i.e., accessed without parentheses). It’s a way to use getter, setter, and deleter methods with simple attribute access syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Why use @property?\n",
        "\n",
        "To control access to instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To add logic when getting, setting, or deleting an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "To keep attribute access simple while hiding complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-🔹 Why is Polymorphism Important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that works with objects of different classes, as long as they follow the same interface (have the same methods). This means you can extend your system with new classes without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplifies Code Maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "By relying on polymorphic behavior, you avoid lots of if-else or switch statements checking object types. Instead, you simply call the method, and the correct behavior happens automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supports Runtime Behavior Changes\n",
        "\n",
        "Through method overriding, polymorphism enables objects to behave differently even when accessed through a common reference, enabling dynamic behavior at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encourages Code Reuse\n",
        "\n",
        "You can define generic functions or classes that operate on the parent type but work seamlessly with any subclass, reducing duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15.What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be inherited by other classes. It often includes one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes, enforcing a certain structure and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Why use Abstract Classes?\n",
        "\n",
        "To define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To force subclasses to implement specific methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "To enable polymorphism with a shared base.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16.What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-🔹 Advantages of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each class handles a specific part of the program, so you can work on one part without affecting others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "Through inheritance, classes can reuse code from other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "This reduces duplication and speeds up development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Internal object details are hidden from the outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "Only necessary parts are exposed via methods, improving security and data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility through Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects of different classes can be treated uniformly based on shared methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Class Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "A class variable is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is defined inside the class but outside any method.\n",
        "\n",
        "All objects of the class access the same class variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Changing the class variable affects all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used to store data that should be common to every instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "An instance variable is unique to each instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is usually defined inside the __init__() method using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each object has its own copy of the instance variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Changing an instance variable affects only that particular object.\n",

        "Ans:-Purpose of __del__\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when its reference count drops to zero and the garbage collector cleans it up).\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Polymorphism means \"many forms\" — it allows objects of different classes related by inheritance to be treated as instances of a common parent class, but each class can have its own implementation of the same method.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Base (Parent) Class defines a method — for example, speak().\n",
        "\n",
        "Derived (Child) Classes override that method with their own version.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call the method on a base class reference pointing to a child object, the child’s method runs. This is called method overriding and is the core of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can write generic code that works on the parent class but behaves differently depending on the actual subclass object passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Method chaining is a programming technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself (self), so you can immediately call another method on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This leads to more concise and readable code, especially when performing a series of operations on the same object.\n",

        "To create function-like objects (also called functors).\n",
