        "Ans:-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods/functions) that the object can have.\n",

        "1. Class Method\n",
        "\n",
        "A class method is bound to the class, not the instance.\n",

        "\n",
        "Defined with the @classmethod decorator.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Method overloading means having multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number or types of arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "It lets you call the same method name with different kinds of inputs, and the method behaves accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12.What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows the child class to modify or extend the behavior of that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13.What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The @property decorator allows you to define methods in a class that behave like attributes (i.e., accessed without parentheses). It‚Äôs a way to use getter, setter, and deleter methods with simple attribute access syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚úÖ Why use @property?\n",
        "\n",
        "To control access to instance attributes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Code Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that works with objects of different classes, as long as they follow the same interface (have the same methods). This means you can extend your system with new classes without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplifies Code Maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "By relying on polymorphic behavior, you avoid lots of if-else or switch statements checking object types. Instead, you simply call the method, and the correct behavior happens automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supports Runtime Behavior Changes\n",
        "\n",
        "Through method overriding, polymorphism enables objects to behave differently even when accessed through a common reference, enabling dynamic behavior at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encourages Code Reuse\n",
        "\n",
        "You can define generic functions or classes that operate on the parent type but work seamlessly with any subclass, reducing duplication.\n",

        "**15.What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be inherited by other classes. It often includes one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes, enforcing a certain structure and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚úÖ Why use Abstract Classes?\n",
        "\n",
        "To define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To force subclasses to implement specific methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Polymorphism means \"many forms\" ‚Äî it allows objects of different classes related by inheritance to be treated as instances of a common parent class, but each class can have its own implementation of the same method.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Base (Parent) Class defines a method ‚Äî for example, speak().\n",
        "\n",
        "Derived (Child) Classes override that method with their own version.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call the method on a base class reference pointing to a child object, the child‚Äôs method runs. This is called method overriding and is the core of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can write generic code that works on the parent class but behaves differently depending on the actual subclass object passed.\n",

        "**24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Method chaining is a programming technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself (self), so you can immediately call another method on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This leads to more concise and readable code, especially when performing a series of operations on the same object.\n",

        "\n",
